EEG Toolbox
------------------

This is the EEG Toolbox, which we compiled from general scripts in use in the
Computational Memory Lab.


To Install
----------

This toolbox is a set of Matlab functions.  As such, you just have to put them
somewhere in your path and add it to your Matlab path.

The HTML documentation, which is just an easy way to browse around all the
functions, is available separately.  Just download it and point your browser at
it.
